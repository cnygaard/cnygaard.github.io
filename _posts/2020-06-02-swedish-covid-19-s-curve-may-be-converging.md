Disclaimer I am not an health professional nor am I trained in making these kind of predictions.It is based upon fork of work from Daner Ferhadi Dferhadi Credit[ https://www.kaggle.com/dferhadi/covid-19-predictions-growth-factor-and-calculus ](< https://www.kaggle.com/dferhadi/covid-19-predictions-growth-factor-and-calculus>)

I think that the Swedish Covid-19 S-curve may finally be converging. Graphically it loks like the orange upper

path of the curve is finally moving in the right direction.
